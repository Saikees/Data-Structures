Practice with Data Structures
------

Basic C++ programs to practice commenting, linked lists, encapsulation, and using git. These were originally programs for class but I wanted to clean them up.

Program #1 - build a linked list for a symbol table. allow the user to add, modify, remove, and display information for a single symbol; also allow a 'display all'.
